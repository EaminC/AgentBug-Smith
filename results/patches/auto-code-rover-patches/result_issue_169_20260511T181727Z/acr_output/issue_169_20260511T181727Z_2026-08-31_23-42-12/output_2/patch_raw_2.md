The user reports an issue with file names extracted from the chat: sometimes the filenames are wrapped in backticks (`) or square brackets ([]), and those characters end up in the filenames. The existing code in `parse_chat` strips some invalid path characters (`<>"|?*`) but does not strip the wrapping backticks or brackets.

To fix this, the filename extraction should strip any surrounding backticks or square brackets from the captured filename string after removing illegal characters. This will normalize the filenames and prevent output files from having unwanted characters in the name.

We can do this by adding a `.strip("`[]")` call on the extracted filename after the `re.sub` call.

No other changes are needed.
